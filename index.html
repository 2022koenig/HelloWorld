    <h1>Hello World!</h1>  
    <p1> HTML is the main language in coding to create Web pages. HTML is made up of many elements that describe what you're writing, like a heading or a paragraph. The elements are represented by tags which are the headings and paragraphs like I just said. These tags are not shown on the actual website, but you need them to tell the code what you want to use it for. </p1> 
    <br> <p2>The main reason I chose this class is that programming interests me a lot. It also shows me how to create a website and what code to use, if I would need to make one in the future. The last reason I chose this class is also just so I have the skills for Web Page Design in the future.</p2>
